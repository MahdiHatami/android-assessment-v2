# TicketSwap Android Assessment (https://github.com/TicketSwap/android-assessment-v2)

### You can found my solution to this assessment

As you know our business is centered on events like concerts and festivals. We love bringing people together to enjoy the best artists and events.
As you probably know by now, since the Zombie Virus breakout we cannot do this anymore, people have to stay far away from each other so this biblical nightmare can end soon.
But that does not mean we are defeated, in fact we decided that we should put our brains at work to help with this unprecendeted catastrophe, and we started working on an app to help with the vaccination process.
Nobody likes Zombies. We want to bring people back to concerts, and it would be nice if they didn't eat each others!

One of our Android developers started working on a basic app to enable people to:
- Get informed about the vaccines
- Choose one of the available vaccines
- Book an appointment to the nearest vaccination center

Unfortunately he was bitten while coming to the office, he knew he had not much time left so, heroically, he completed the first version of the app while slowly turning into a zombie. We all love him, and wish him a prompt recovery, but at this time we cannot rely on his coding skills for obvious reasons.

That's why we need your help.

In this repo you will find the code for the app, we would like you to perform a code review and give us your expert opinion on several topics about the quality of the code. We do not need you to write or rewrite any part of it, just tell us what you think of it.

- Is the code compliant with Android best practices?
- Do you see anything you would do differently? Why?
- Is the code easy to understand?
- Any other thoughts?

Thank you for your help, please provide your review in a text file stating, for each comment, the file name, the line and the severity of the issue. If the comment does not refer to any specific code line just put it at the top as a sentence but please state how severe the issue is according to you.

Good luck!
